Password Reuse Visualizer
-------------------------

This is the password visualizer code for Privacy Watchdog. This add-on takes the passwords stored in your Firefox password manager (as well as the sites they're used on) and visualizes them as a force-directed graph, using d3.js. It also alerts you if some of your passwords are similar (by edit distance).
